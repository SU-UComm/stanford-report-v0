                        The muskrat, a stocky brown rodent the size of a Chihuahua – with a tail like a mouse, teeth like a beaver and an exceptional ability to bounce back from
                        rapid die-offs – has lived for thousands of years in one of Earth’s largest freshwater deltas, in northeastern Alberta, Canada.

                        Part of Todd’s job is to oversee Give & Go, a year-round donation program. Sustainability is a core value in Residential & Dining Enterprises’ (R&DE) and
                        the organization has been supporting reuse for more than two decades (and recycling for many more). The Give & Go program, formalized in 2013, expanded
                        those efforts significantly. In 10 years, Give & Go, known among students for the images of alpacas that accompany its branding (“Alpaca my stuff …”), has
                        diverted 456 tons of waste from landfills, including through innovative partnerships with local community organizations and the First-Generation and/or
                        Low-Income (FLI) Student Success Center on campus. Give & Go is just one part of R&DE’s sustainability program, which in turn is part of Stanford’s broader
                        mission to achieve zero waste by 2030. (Stanford has placed first in the National Wildlife Federation’s Campus Race to Zero competition in the per-capita
                        recycling category for two years in a row.)

                        New research focused on muskrat population dynamics in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, published June 24 in Communications Biology, demonstrates the
                        vulnerability of even this most protected landscape to human-driven changes to water systems and the global climate.

                        “A little muskrat in the middle of this northern part of Canada is an indicator of human impacts at the local, regional and global level,” said Stanford
                        University environmental biologist Elizabeth Hadly, co-principal investigator of the study. “Climate change and dams have changed the ability of this
                        exemplar species - and many plants, animals and people who depend on the same ecosystem - to thrive in this large area.”

                        The research comes on the heels of a draft finding from the United Nations that Canada’s Wood Buffalo National Park – the park and World Heritage Site that
                        contains the Peace-Athabasca Delta is likely in danger from threats related to governance as well as hydropower and oil sands development upstream of the
                        delta. Previous research has implicated climate change as a driver of long-term drying in the delta and hydroelectric dams on the Peace River as a cause of
                        reduced flooding.

                    <p>
                        “Our results speak to the impacts on the biotic environment of long-term drying – whatever the cause – and this has implications for science and
                        environmental policy,” said Stanford hydrologist Steve Gorelick, co-principal investigator of the study and a senior fellow at Stanford Woods Institute for
                        the Environment.

                        Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) populations have always followed a boom-and-bust cycle, with their numbers crashing in dry years and peaking after major
                        floods. But in recent decades the booms - and the area of the delta inhabited by muskrats during wet years - have been shrinking. The authors found the most
                        recent year of net population increase after flooding, 2014, was less productive than any such growth year going back to the 1970s.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While many creatures rely on the dynamic nature of wetlands to survive, muskrats depend heavily on floodwaters, rivers and streams to travel and disperse
                        beyond their natal ponds. “During a big flood, a lot of muskrats will drown. Some will get swept up into trees and stay put,” said lead study author Ellen
                        Ward, who worked on the research as a PhD student in Earth system science at Stanford. “But some will stay in the water, either floating or clinging to
                        debris, and get swept along quite far.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As floodwaters recede, the dispersed muskrats enjoy habitat gains that support larger populations. They graze intensively on plants near the shore, strongly
                        influencing plant life in the area and providing prey for fox, lynx, mink and other predators.
